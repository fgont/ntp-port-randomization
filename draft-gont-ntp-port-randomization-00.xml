    <abstract>
      <t>The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes. Some of these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and therefore require the use of a service/well-known port as the local port number. However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a service/well-known port is not required, employing such well-known/service port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks, since knowledge of such port number is typically required for such attacks. This document formally updates RFC5905, recommending the use of port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP service port is not required.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet protocols, and currently specified in <xref target="RFC5905"/>. Since its its original implementation, standardization and deployment, a number of vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in some of its implementations <xref target="NTP-VULN"/>. Some of these vulnerabilities allow for off-path/blind attacks, where an attacker can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers for achieving Denial of Service (DoS), time-shifts, and other undesirable outcomes. Many of these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a target association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr, srcport, dstaddr, dstport, keyid}. Some of these parameters may be easily known or guessed.</t>

      <t>NTP can operate in several modes. Some of these modes rely on the ability to receive unsolicited packets, and therefore require the use of a service/well-known port number. However, for modes where the use of a service/well-known port is not required, employing such well-known/service port improves the ability of an attacker to perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of such port number is typically required for such attacks). This document formally updates RFC5905, recommending the use of port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP service port is not required.</t>

      <section title="Update to RFC5905">

<t>The specification of the &quot;srcport&quot; and &quot;dstport&quot; peer process variables from Section 9.1 (&quot;Peer Process Variables&quot;) of <xref target="RFC5905"/> is updated as follows:
</t>

<t>
srcport: UDP port number of the server or reference clock.  This
 becomes the destination port number in packets sent from this
   association.  When operating in symmetric modes (1 and 2), this field
   must contain the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In
   other modes, it SHOULD contain a randomized transport-protocol, as specified in <xref target="RFC6056"/>.
</t>

<t>dstport: UDP port number of the client. In the case of broadcast server mode (5) and symmetric modes (1 and 2), it must contain the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In other cases, it SHOULD contain a randomized transport-protocol, as specified in <xref target="RFC6056"/>. The value in this variable becomes the source port number in packets sent from this association.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The security implications of predictable numeric identifiers <xref target="I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids"/> (and of predictable transport-protocol port numbers <xref target="RFC6056"/> in particular) have been known for a long time now. However, the NTP specification have traditionally followed a pattern of employing common settings and code even when not strictly necessary, which at times has resulted in negative security and privacy implications (see e.g. <xref target="I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization"/>). The use of the NTP service port (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for all operating modes, and such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully perform off-path/blind attacks against NTP. Therefore, this document formally updates <xref target="RFC5905"/>, recommending the use of transport-protocol port randomization when use of the NTP service port is not required.</t>
