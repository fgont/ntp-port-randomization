       Port Randomization in the Network Time Protocol Version 4
                  draft-gont-ntp-port-randomization-01

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes.  Some of
   these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and
   therefore require the use of a service/well-known port as the local
   port number.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a
   service/well-known port is not required, employing such well-known/
   service port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers to
   perform blind/off-path attacks, since knowledge of such port number
   is typically required for such attacks.  This document formally
   updates RFC5905, recommending the use of port randomization for those
   modes where use of the NTP service port is not required.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet
   protocols, and currently specified in [RFC5905].  Since its its
   original implementation, standardization and deployment, a number of
   vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in
   some of its implementations [NTP-VULN].  Some of these
   vulnerabilities allow for off-path/blind attacks, where an attacker
   can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers for achieving Denial
   of Service (DoS), time-shifts, and other undesirable outcomes.  Many
   of these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a
   target association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr,
   srcport, dstaddr, dstport, keyid}. Some of these parameters may be
   easily known or guessed.

   NTP can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes rely on the
   ability to receive unsolicited packets, and therefore require the use
   of a service/well-known port number.  However, for modes where the
   use of a service/well-known port is not required, employing such
   well-known/service port improves the ability of an attacker to
   perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of such port number
   is typically required for such attacks).  This document formally
   updates RFC5905, recommending the use of port randomization for those
   modes where use of the NTP service port is not required.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC5905

   The specification of the "srcport" and "dstport" peer process
   variables from Section 9.1 ("Peer Process Variables") of [RFC5905] is
   updated as follows:

   srcport: UDP port number of the server or reference clock.  This
   becomes the destination port number in packets sent from this
   association.  When operating in symmetric modes (1 and 2), this field
   must contain the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In
   other modes, it SHOULD contain a randomized port number, as specified
   in [RFC6056].

   dstport: UDP port number of the client.  In the case of broadcast
   server mode (5) and symmetric modes (1 and 2), it must contain the
   NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In other cases, it
   SHOULD contain a randomized port number, as specified in [RFC6056].
   The value in this variable becomes the source port number in packets
   sent from this association.

   NOTE:
      The port number is to be randomized on a per-association basis.
      That is, a random port number is selected when an association is
      first mobilized, and the selected port number is expected to
      remain constant during the life of an association.  This

4.  Implementation Status

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication of this
   document as an RFC.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their

   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   OpenNTPD:
      [OpenNTPD] has never explictly set the local port of NTP clients,
      and thus employs the ephemeral port selection algorithm
      implemented by the operating system.  Thus, on all operating
      systems that implement port randomization (such as current
      versions of OpenBSD, Linux, and FreeBSD), OpenNTPD will employ
      port randomization for client ports.

      [chrony] [TBD].

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of predictable numeric identifiers
   [I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids] (and of predictable transport-
   protocol port numbers [RFC6056] in particular) have been known for a
   long time now.  However, the NTP specification have traditionally
   followed a pattern of employing common settings and code even when
   not strictly necessary, which at times has resulted in negative
   security and privacy implications (see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization]).  The use of the NTP service port
   (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for all
   operating modes, and such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of
   reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully
   perform off-path/blind attacks against NTP.  Therefore, this document
   formally updates [RFC5905], recommending the use of transport-
   protocol port randomization when use of the NTP service port is not
   required.

   This issue has been tracked by US-CERT with VU#597821, and has been
   assigned CVE-2019-11331.
